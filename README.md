## Abstract
Biosurfactants produced by several microbes exhibit various advantages as compared to petrochemical surfactants. Although Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been used as the model organism for their production, the complex regulatory network controlling the rhamnolipid production and its classification as an opportunistic pathogen are major downsides, thus highlighting Pseudomonas putida as an alternative producing host. This project aims to reconstruct the rhamnolipids pathway originally existent in Pseudomonas aeruginosa into Pseudomonas putida using metabolic engineering tools such as MEWpy, which allows to model and optimize microbial production on Genome-Scale Metabolic Models.
